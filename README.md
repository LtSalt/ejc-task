# README

This repo hosts the [code](https://github.com/LtSalt/ejc-task/blob/main/ejc-task-script.R) for the EJC fellowship task given to me by Zeit Online. For convencience reasons, I used the RStudio Gui to save the final graphic.

The alternative Datawrapper chart can be seen [here](https://www.datawrapper.de/_/w0l1D/). In my experience, interactive R charts with plotly or ggiraph tend to look not very polished and can mess up some of your design choices. I therefore chose to not reproduce the full interactive Datawrapper experience but went for a clean static chart.
